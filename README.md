# 🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data from Zomato to uncover insights about food trends, user preferences, restaurant ratings, and more.

The analysis was performed using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** and the dashboard was built using **Power BI**.

## 📌 Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Collection**  
   The dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/zomato-restaurants-data) and contains details about restaurants in India, including:
   - Name
   - Location
   - Ratings
   - Cuisine
   - Cost
   - Votes, etc.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Performed in **Jupyter Notebook**
   - Cleaned null values, handled duplicates, formatted columns, etc.
   - Exported the cleaned dataset as `.xlsx` for visualization

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Imported the cleaned dataset into **Power BI**
   - Created custom measures (like Popularity Score, Vote Normalization, etc.)
   - Built a dynamic and interactive dashboard
